    "Instead of both $\\vec{w_j}$ and $b_j$ per class, we'll put the bias term at the\n",
    "beginning of the weight vector and add a term $1$ at the start of each sample.\n",

    "\\mat{S} = \\mat{X} \\mat{W}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "- $\\mat{X}$ is a matrix of shape $N\\times (D+1)$ containing $N$ samples in it's rows;\n",
    "- $\\mat{W}$ is of shape $(D+1)\\times C$ and contains the learnable classifier parameters (weights and bias);\n",
    "- $\\mat{S}$ is therefore a $N\\times C$ matrix of the class scores of each sample.\n",

    "1. In the following discussions we'll use the notation $\\vec{x_i}$ to denote the $i$-th training sample\n",

    "2. The reason we put the samples in the rows of $\\mat{X}$ and not columns (as is the convention in some texts) is\n",
    "   because that's the convention in the pytorch library: the batch dimension is always the first one. This has many\n",
